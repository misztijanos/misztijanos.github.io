  <blockquote><p>We had an opportunity to take a very last minute trip overseas. We contacted Helen and she bent over backwards to help us. She even dropped us at the airport! As soon as we arrived at our hotel we had pictures and a video of our cats waiting for us. It was such a relief to have the daily updates. When we got home the cats were happy and the garden looked great. Thanks Helen!</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>My husband and I travel routinely and we generally had family take care of our place. For one trip nobody in our family was available so we called Helen in desperation. It was the right decision. We received daily pictures and updates and she even took care of some personal issues that came up while we were away. The cats were obviously brushed and cared for and my plants looked great! If you need a good sitter I truly recommend Vancouver Pet Sitters.</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>I've used Vancouver Pet Sitters in the past and I can say it has been the best pet/house care I've had. I had to leave the country for two months and leave my two cats, plants and home on their watch. While I was away I always received daily updates/pictures of my cats. That keep me very tranquil and allowed me to enjoy my vacation. When I got back I was very happy to see all my plants as If I never left, my house was clean and even dinner ready. (You can asked them for whatever food you want to have for when you return and they'll have it for you!) I'm very pleased with their services and 100% recommend them.</p></blockquote>
