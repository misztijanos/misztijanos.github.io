	<h1>About Us</h1><hr>
	<p>Here at Vancouver Pet Sitting we're very passionate about travel and animals. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to have pets and travel. Since not having pets didn't feel right, we started volunteering at the local animal shelters wherever we travelled. Now, all these years later, we have pets adopted from Costa Rica, Panama and our latest addition to the family from India.</p>
	<p>Having adopted so many strays on our travels we needed to start using pet sitters. We quickly realized there weren't many great options. It seemed there was always an issue when we returned. We believe there is more to pet sitting than a quick visit to leave some food. Pet sitting is about developing a good relationship with you and your pet and providing you both the comfort and sense of security you need while you're away. It's also about you coming back to a perfectly cared for home and pet.</p>
	<p>We love what we do and we always take the extra time and care you'd expect from a professional service.</p>
	<p>Vancouver Pet Sitting is family owned and operated.</p>
