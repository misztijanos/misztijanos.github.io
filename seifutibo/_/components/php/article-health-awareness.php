  <p>Seifu and his Illness</p>
  <p>Seifu was aware in the early 90s that he was a type II diabetic and he did what he could to stay healthy but it was not good enough what he was doing to prevent the kidney failure in November  2008. Seifu has read and learned quite a lot about the diabetic illness and he became more involved in recent years in talking about the illness and advising other people how to stay healthy even if they have the disease.

If all the above is done people with the diabetic disease can leave a full life otherwise the consequence is irreversible.
