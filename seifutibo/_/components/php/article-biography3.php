      <p>Canada</p>
      <p>1978 defected to Canada granted a political asylum</p>
      <p>Seifu loved his country his family and his many friends he left behind but because of the uncertain future in his native land and due to fear for his life, he was forced to stay in Canada in1979. Seifu and his two friend lived in one of the Montreal hotels at the expense of the Canadian government, until their paperwork was completed and finally they were granted a political asylum. They were given a work permit and started working to suppot themselves. During his short stay in Canada Seifu had the opportunity to be part of the movie Running and appeared with Michael Douglas as an American Marathon runner. Seifu had a hard time adjusting to the climate in Montreal and he consulted with his cousin who resided in Los Angeles and finally he joined him in 1979.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles</p>
      <p>Robbed and survived</p>
      <p>Few weeks after Seifu arrived in Los Angeles his first encounter is shocking and unforgettable. As he was waiting for someone to help him start his boxing carrier in America he wanted to work to support himself and he went on getting a temporary work permit. He found a job as a gas station attendant and was employed at the world gas station in West Los Angeles. One afternoon as Seifu was training a new cashier a young looking African American robber entered the kiosk and demanded money by pointing his gun towards Seifu. Both Seifu and the young trainee was shocked and didn’t know what to do and they hesitated, at this time the gunman shot towards Seifu but the bullet missed him and hit the young trainee in his stomach and the gunman helped himself at the cash register and instantly fled on foot on one direction. As the young trainee lying on the ground bleeding Seifu called an ambulance and a police and the young trainee was taken to the nearby hospital and luckily he survived after being attended in the hospital for two weeks. At the time of the robbery a mail man was passing around the area and has seen the person who committed the robbery and he knew the guy in the neighborhood and he reported to the police. The person who committed the robbery worked at the nearby safe way store as a security guard and he used his work gun to committee the crime. He was arrested and in the later day Seifu testified and the robber was convicted. After many years Seifu had another less dramatic incident while he was in a taxi business but he with stand all the adversities and he survived with the grace of God and with the strength of his faith. </p>
