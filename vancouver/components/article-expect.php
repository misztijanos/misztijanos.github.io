	<h1>What To Expect</h1><hr>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>You can expect professional, personal, compassionate and respectful care for your pets and home.</p></li>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>We will earn your pets trust and provide them honest companionship to help them cope with your absence. We will never leave your pets without being 100% sure they're all safe, comfortable and have been adequately provided for.</p></li>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>When we say we'll spend 30 or 60 minutes with your pet we mean we'll spend those 30 or 60 minutes giving them plenty of physical, emotional, mental and verbal stimulation. We always make sure they're healthy and comfortable and offer them plenty of play, brushes and cuddles for the entire visit.</p></li>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>It's only after we've spent the entire visit with your pet that we'll tidy litter boxes, care for your plants and fluff up beds. We can even hide treats for your pets to hunt for to keep them occupied. We provide these services at no cost to you and we don't subtract it from the time spent visiting your pet.</p></li>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>As part of every trip we also do a full visual check of your home and property ensuring nothing is out of place or suspicious. We can rotate lights, move cars, take in the mail and do whatever you require to know your house looks lived in and everything is secure. Again, this is provided outside of the time spent with your pets and at no charge to you.</p></li>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>You'll also receive plenty of pictures/videos and you can expect us to be available to you 24/7 without exception for the entire duration of your time away. </p>
    	<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span><p>In case of any emergencies or if you need anything done while you're away, just let us know and we'll be happy to help.</p>
