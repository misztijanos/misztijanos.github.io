	<section class="description">
		<p><img src="images/port/janos-logo.png" alt="logo" class="desc-logo"> I built this site from scratch. I started with an empty directory, and an empty file in Sublime Text. I did not import any features, I did not copy/paste in code snippets. Other than the automatically generated .git files, every byte of information in the site's directory went in through my keyboard, and I can explain what every single line of code does. I don't usually code this way (I re-use components, A LOT), but I noticed that a lot of my work tends to look the same: a PHP back-end of some kind (or, at least, html templates put together using PHP), heavy use of Javascript and Javascript libraries for ready made effects, or sometimes even a ready made Wordpress theme I only superficially modified. </p>

		<p>That's an efficient way to produce resilient, error-proof websites (as long as you build on solid ground: only "borrow" from pros, who develop properly licensed, properly tested frameworks, code libraries and themes, or you develop and carefully test your own re-usable components). You build websites the way a factory would build a car: have a carefully planned out workflow, and put a finished product together from solid, reliable, safe parts you or someone else built at another time. But it doesn't really showcase the developer's understanding of the FUNDAMENTALS. CSS3 is the most fundamental skill in the arsenal of a front end developer, and this site is meant to show how easy it is to use these days.</p>

		<p>So this site has no traditional "programming". No back-end, no PHP, Ruby, Python etc., at all. No Javascript at all, no server calls. It's a static HTML5/CSS3 website. All effects are CSS-only. I decided to build it that way because modern CSS3 is a sufficiently advanced language that you don't need anything else, for a web developer's portfolio site. If it was for a client, a static site would not suffice, because, in a static site, all updates must be made in HTML, and formatted with CSS. So a client would need a back-end, they would not enjoy updating their portfolio or blog by editing a text file, and then formatting their posts by editing another plain text file. I do. In fact I find it easier.</p>

		<p>As a final disclaimer, I should note that, just because I wrote all the code myself, doesn't mean I didn't use other people's work. The techniques/patterns I use were developed by others (big shoutout to everyone at css-tricks.com, their articles and code examples are invaluable to a front end developer). I also looked at other sites for design inspiration. Hard to say what came from whom, but it's definitely not all my original design.</p>
