		<p><img src="images/about-headshot.png" alt="logo" class="desc-logo"> I am a Front-end Developer. I studied Computer Science in high school and college, I have over 10 years experience as an amateur developer, and have been developing commercially for the past two years, providing front-end development, producing high quality responsive websites and exceptional user experience.</p>
		<p>Clients often approach me when they need a developer who can provide:</p>

		<ul class="about-list clear-both">
	    <li>Responsive HTML5/CSS3</li>
	    <li>JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and other frameworks)</li>
	    <li>High-level user experience</li>
	    <li>Best practices</li>
	    <li>Standard compliance</li>
	    <li>Performance</li>
	    <li>Image editing</li>
	    <li>Git</li>
	    <li>WordPress</li>
	  </ul>
<p>The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.</p>

<p>Often front-end development of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.</p>

<p>My clients have found that launching with a well considered and well developed front-end has saved them time and money and makes for a product that is consistently of high quality.</p>
